# Pygame-Tetris
A Tetris implementation using pygame.

# Running the game
Starting the game requires python and pygame to be installed.

A singleplayer game can be started by running the singleplayer_run.py file with python.

For multiplayer games, a server instance must be started by running the server_run.py file, and two client instances must connect to it by running the client_run.py file. The game will start as soon as both clients are connected. Currently, setting the addres and port for the server and clients can only be done by editing the server_run.py and client_run.py files.
